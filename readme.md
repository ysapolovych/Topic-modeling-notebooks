This repo contains old Jupyter notebooks I used to preprocess a text corpus and generate various topic models. A corpus was dedicated to [deterrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), and the main purpose of analysis was to see what subtopics authors typically write about, as well as how these subtopics vary over time.

deterrence_analysis.ipynb contains interacitve visualizations generated with PyLDAivs

Some parts of the notebooks were slightly changed (mainly file paths) due to non-diclosure.
